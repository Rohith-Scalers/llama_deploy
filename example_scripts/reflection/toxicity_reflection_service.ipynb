    "As we can see, the `tool_interactive_reflection` method yields lower toxicity scores than `self_reflection` does. Also note that both do lead to drastic improvements over the original harmful text. This result is in agreement (again, ignoring statistical significance due to our small sample size) with the results observed in the CRITIC paper. Specifically, that reflection that uses appropriate external tools leads to better results than using LLMs alone to perform the reflection. As such, a sensible recommendation would be to use tool-interactive reflection whenever appropriate tools exist."
